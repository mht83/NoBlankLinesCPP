Once upon a time, in a land of indeterminate location,
there lived a curious cat named Whiskers.
Whiskers had an unusual hobby: collecting invisible art.
One day, Whiskers decided to host an exhibition.
The gallery was filled with... well, nothing.
Visitors were perplexed, wandering through the empty space,
whispering, "Is this some kind of joke?"
Meanwhile, Whiskers sat in the corner, purring with delight,
as people admired the emperor's new paintings.
The end.
